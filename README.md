### Objective

<br>

- Write a program that reads a string and then prints a diamond shaped array based on the characters of the string. As an example, if the string has the value "SAMPLE", then the program should print the pattern

```
      S

   SAMPMAS
  SAMPLPMAS
 SAMPLELPMAS
  SAMPLPMAS
   SAMPMAS
    SAMAS
     SAS
      S

- The program should work for a string up to ten characters long. If a user supplies a string that is longer than ten characters, the program should use only the first ten characters in forming the pattern.
